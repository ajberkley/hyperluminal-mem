KNOWN BUGS

- test 'ghash-table fails on ABCL because (sxhash #0A42)
  returns different values at each call

- on SBCL, allocating large buffers (0.5GB) with (cffi-sys:with-foreign-pointer ...)
  returns a foreign pointer so it seems to succeed,
  but actually accessing the buffer crashes with "Memory fault at ..."
