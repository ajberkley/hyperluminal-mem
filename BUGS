FIXED BUGS

- on SBCL, allocating large buffers (0.5GB) with (cffi-sys:with-foreign-pointer ...)
  returns a foreign pointer so it seems to succeed,
  but actually accessing the buffer crashes with "Memory fault at ..."

  There's a patch floating on SBCL mailing list, and hyperluminal-mem
  now avoids stack-allocating large buffers
  
NOT BUGS

- none yet
