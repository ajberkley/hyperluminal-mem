========== TO DO ==========

define-compiler-macro on msize, msize-box, mwrite and mwrite-box
for constant value or constant :type that open-code
the calls to msize-box/<N> and mwrite-box/<N>

everything else...

========== DONE ==========

mwrite-box/string and mread-box/string use compact representation:
  they pack as many characters as possible in each CPU word

(mwrite) should not call (detect-n-words), but simply dispatch the write
  and get the return value, which is the actual number of written words.
  As last, it should write the box header.
