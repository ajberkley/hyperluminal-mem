========== TO DO ==========

(mwrite) should not call (detect-n-words), but simply dispatch the write
and get the return value, which is the actual number of written words.
As last, it should write the box header.

bit-vector

everything else...

========== DONE ==========

mwrite-box/string and mread-box/string use compact representation:
  they pack as many characters as possible in each CPU word
